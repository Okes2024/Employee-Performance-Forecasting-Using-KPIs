# Employee Performance Forecasting Using KPIs

This project demonstrates how to forecast employee performance using key performance indicators (KPIs) through machine learning models. It includes both a regression model using Random Forest and a time-series model using LSTM for individual forecasting over time.

## Features

- âœ… Random Forest Regression for performance prediction
- ðŸ“ˆ LSTM Time-Series Forecasting for future performance trends
- ðŸ§ª Synthetic KPI dataset generation
- ðŸ“Š Streamlit dashboard interface (optional)
- ðŸ’¾ Model saving and loading with joblib
